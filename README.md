# f-puzzles Keyboard Shortcuts
<br>

* For speedy navigation of f-puzzles' menus. For example, to select a constraint: first type **'t'** to open the constraint tools menu, then enter the shortcut for a constraint. To open cosmetic tools type **'tt'**.
* The shortcuts are customizable by changing the 'User Edit' section of the script. 
* When a cosmetic tool is selected the keyboard shortcuts are disabled. Use 'ctrl g' to deselect the cosmetic tool and re-enable shortcuts.
* With the 'New Grid' popup open, select a number (3 - 9) to load a new grid of that size. Use 'ctrl \<number\>' to add 10. (e.g. 'ctrl 0' loads a 10X10 grid.)

> *Note: The solver console shortcuts will not work until SudokuSolver has been installed and connected. You can find it [here.](https://github.com/dclamage/SudokuSolver)*
